# SplineDirectory

There are a seemingly innumerable amount of splines that have been defined in academic literature.  This project is an attempt to catalog the various and unique splines that have been described in peer-review literature.  Below is a table that summarizes the various splines and orders them by the spline's prefix.  As the initial definition of splines appears in Schoenberg's publication as simply *splines*, i.e. having no prefix, it appears first in this table.

# Bookeeping vision of the project
- The table above is meant to be a quick resource & index to more detailed sub-pages within this repository

- In the table above, links to seminal publications should, wherever possible, point to the article's listing as hosted or refrenced to on the publisher's website.
  - Even if open/free access, do not point to the PDF directly, e.g.
    - This: https://www.ams.org/journals/qam/1946-04-01/S0033-569X-1946-15914-5/
    - Not:  https://www.ams.org/journals/qam/1946-04-01/S0033-569X-1946-15914-5/S0033-569X-1946-15914-5.pdf 

  - Within each spline's own page in this repository additional options may be provided for improved accessibility.  While I can't enforce rules on someone else's clone or fork of this project (see Unlicense) at least within this original git repository we will obey the law and spirit of US copyright laws as it pertains to providing links to papers, e.g. no links to pirated copies, cracks, hacks, or unapproved FTP servers.
    - Legally-obtainable Arxiv pre-print, ResearchGate, author hosted copies (assuming they are within their copyright to do so), etc. are welcomed.
